vim-rainbow-parentheses
===================

A Vim plugin that uses color to help identify matching parentheses and other paired delimiters according to their depth by using a different color for each successive level.  For more information, please see the [documentation](https://github.com/dbarsam/vim-rainbow-parentheses/blob/master/doc/rainbow.txt).

Rainbow Parentheses is a feature that has been implemented nd re-implemented for vim before. This plugin modifies the techniques found in other plugins based on personal work flow and really doesn't add anything new.
