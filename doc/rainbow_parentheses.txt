				   *rainbow_parentheses-about*
1. Overview~

As everyone knows, the most complex codes were composed of
a mass of different kinds of parentheses. This plugin will 
help you reading these codes by showing different level of 
parentheses in different color.

=============================================================
			       *rainbow_parentheses-configure*
2. Simple Configuration~

first, put the rainbow_parentheses.vim to dir vim73/autoload
second, add the follow sentence to your .vimrc or _vimrc :
	au syntax * cal rainbow_parentheses#activate()

third, restart your vim and enjoy coding.

			        *rainbow_parentheses-advanced*
3. Advanced Configuration~

This plugin support 4 kinds of parentheses' highlighting:
	( ) , [ ] , { } , < > 
the simple configuration will activate (),[]and{} by default.
if you want to decide which to highlight, use this function:
	rainbow_parentheses#load(type, max)
means, you can add a sentence to your .vimrc like this:
	au syntax * cal rainbow_parentheses#load('([' , 32)

in this case you enabled two kinds of parentheses' 
highlighting. you needn't to append an #activate() command , 
because the function #load() will automatically call 
#active() at last. 
It's not recommended to enable the < > 's highlighting , 
because most of programming languages use < and > as compare 
operators, but this plugin can only treat them as brackets.
(what ? you don't code ? then why you need this plugin ? :)

The #load() function will automatically call the #activate(),
this is a design to simplify the configuration for most user.
if you want to use #load() to set this plugin but don't want
to activate it immediately , you can append a #clear() func 
after the #load() func.

To toggle this plugin manually, you can use this function:
	rainbow_parentheses#toggle()

this function is better than it's old versions' , because it
can remember the setting while you call #load() , so you can
call #load() first to load your setting and map a key such 
as <f5> to call #toggle() to enable/disable the highlighting.

The second param of #load() which named max is not an 
important one. but when this value is setted too small, 
something you won't like will occur. And if this value is
setted too large (such as 1000000) , the plugin's lunching 
will cost a lot of time.(the Time complexity is O(max*max)).
I think 16 , 32 and 64 are all ok.

If you don't like the color setted in the plugin , you can 
change it by editting the rainbow_parentheses.vim file. you 
will know how to change it when you entered this file.
