The functionality mentioned here is a plugin, see |add-plugin|.
This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.
You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_rainbow" variable
in your |vimrc| file: >
	:let loaded_rainbow = 1

{Vi does not have any of this}

1. Highlighting matching parentheses				*rainbow-intro* {{{1

Rainbow Parentheses is a plugin that uses color to help identify matching
parentheses and other paired delimiters according to their depth by using a
different color for each successive level.  

The plugin provided the following features:
	1. Infinite depth.
	2. Customization of the colors spectrum used to denote depth.
	3. |Filetype| specialization.

==============================================================================
2. History							*rainbow-history* {{{1

This version was forked from Luo Chen's Rainbow Parentheses Improved and is
currently maintained on github at https://github.com/dbarsam/vim-rainbow-parentheses.

==============================================================================
3. Acknowledgements						*rainbow-acknowledgements* {{{1

Rainbow Parentheses is a feature that has been implemented nd re-implemenented
for vim before. This plugin modifies the techniques found in the follow
plugins based on personal work flow and really doesn't add anything new.

The following is a list of other plugins that perform the same functionality
and may or may not have influenced this plugin:
	* Luo Chen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4176)
	* Kien et al. (https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim)
	* Martin Krischik (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1561)
	* John Gilmore (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1230)

4. Installation							*rainbow-install* {{{1

You can use this script as a plugin by copying the various components to their
respective directory.  See |add-global-plugin| for instructions.

								*rainbow-github*

If you use a bundle manager such as pathogen or vundle, you can use this plugin
via github: https://github.com/dbarsam/vim-rainbow-parentheses.git

==============================================================================
5. Activation							*rainbow-activation* {{{1

Activation for Rainbow Parentheses is a two step process that:
	1. Requires a global activation of the Rainbow Parentheses feature
	   across all buffers.  This state is stored in the |g:rainbow_activate|
	   variable.
	2. Requires a local definition of the delimiters to be used by the
	   Rainbow Parentheses feature.  This state is stored in the 
	   |b:rainbow_matchpairs| variable.

==============================================================================
6. Configuration						*rainbow-configuration* {{{1

								*rainbow-activate* *g:rainbow_activate*
The variable |g:rainbow_activate| stores the plugin's activity state.  If you >
	let g:rainbow_activate = 1
in your vimrc, the plugin will be active from startup.  However, to enable or
disable the plugin after startup, it is recommended that you use the
|RainbowToggle| command.

								*rainbow-matchpairs* *b:rainbow_matchpairs*
The variable |b:rainbow_matchpairs| stores the plugin's delimiter definition for
the buffer.  This definition is stored as a list of matchpair, which are also
stored as a list.  For example, >
	let b:rainbow_matchpairs = [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}']]
is a valid format, defining the delimiter pairs '()', '[]', '{}' for the
current buffer.  To manipulate the |b:rainbow_matchpairs| variable for the
current buffer it is recommended to use the |RainbowInsert| or the |RainbowRemove|
commands.

								*rainbow-filetypes* *g:rainbow_filetype_matchpairs*

The variable |g:rainbow_filetype_matchpairs| stores the plugin's filetype delimiter
specialization.  This definition is stored as a dictionary matching a vim |filetype|
string to a rainbow_matchpair definition.  For example, >
	let g:rainbow_filetype_matchpairs = [
	\[ '*'         , [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}']] ],
	\[ 'tex'       , [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]']] ],
	\[ 'c,cpp,cs'  , [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}']] ],
	\[ 'html'      , [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}'], ['<\a[^>]*>', '</[^>]*>']] ],
	\]
	let b:rainbow_buffer = [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}']]
is a valid format, defining the pairs delimiter'()', '[]', '{}'.

								*rainbow-star*

To allow a general case for filetype specification, Rainbow Parentheses recognizes
the '*' as a fake-filetype.  If the plugin is unable to match the filetype and the
'*' fake-filetype is defined, the plugin will the delimiter definition stored under
the '*' entry.

								*rainbow-colors*

The plugin defines two list |g:rainbow_guifgs| and |g:rainbow_ctermfg| to
define the colors used to denote the parentheses depth.  If the depth exceeds
the number of colors in the list the plugin cycle through the list of colors.

								*rainbow-guifgs* *g:rainbow_guifgs*

The variable |g:rainbow_guifgs| is a list of color strings defined in |rgb.txt|
used to denote depth in gui instances of vim. The value in the list is passed
to the |highlight-guifg| parameter of the |highlight| command.

								*rainbow-ctermfgs* *g:rainbow_ctermfgs*

The variable |g:rainbow_ctermfgs| is a list of color strings defined in |rgb.txt|
used to denote depth in color terminal instances of vim. The value in the list
is passed to the |highlight-ctermfg| parameter of the |highlight| command.

								*g:rainbow_sgroup*

The variable |g:rainbow_sgroup| defines the name used by the plugin to create
syntax regions that define the delimiter pairs defined in|b:rainbow_matchpairs|.

								*g:rainbow_hgroup*

The variable |g:rainbow_hgroup| defines the name used by the plugin to create
highlight group that define the colors used by the delimiter pairs.

==============================================================================
7. Commands							*rainbow-commands* {{{1

								*RainbowToggle*

|RainbowToggle| toggles the Rainbow Parentheses feature.

								*RainbowInsert*

|RainbowInsert| injects delimiters into the current buffer's delimiter list.
The current buffer delimiter list is stored in |b:rainbow_matchpairs|so any
change will be lost when the variable is deleted with the buffer.

								*RainbowRemove*
|RainbowRemove| injects delimiters into the current buffer's delimiter list.
The current buffer delimiter list is stored in |b:rainbow_matchpairs|so any
change will be lost when the variable is deleted with the buffer.
